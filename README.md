# ALL-CAPS
This is a C++ program that capitalizes all of the text in a text file. The program does this by taking the contents of the text file, converting the letters to capital letters, 
and writing the results of the conversion to a new text file. The original copy is then deleted. Each character conversion is displayed on the console.
This program does not consider whether or not the file is empty.
